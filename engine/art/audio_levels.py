"""What every theme in the compendium actually plays at, and what it owes the house.

This is the whole app's audio meter.  It decodes every embedded `.ogg` in the repository -
music and effects, all three games, the engine's own menus - and prints each theme's level
against the **house baseline**, so a new theme, a re-cut set of effects or a fresh rip can be
held to the same loudness as everything already here.

**Loudness is RMS, not peak.**  Peak is the single loudest sample and says nothing about how
loud a sound is: two effects that both peak at -0.5 dBFS are ten decibels apart if one of them
is a click and the other a chord.  Every level here is therefore RMS, in dBFS, with the peak
carried alongside only as the headroom the file has left.  A set that is levelled on peaks -
which is what `puyo-rusto/art/retro_audio.py` did to Mean Bean Machine's effects - comes out
*sounding* hot while every meter says it is fine.

Three numbers describe a theme:

* `music` - the RMS of its music, energy-averaged over every track it may play.  This is the
  bed the whole theme sits on and it is what the baseline pins.
* `effects` - the RMS of its effect set, energy-averaged.
* `balance` - `effects - music`, in dB.  It is the number that says whether a theme's effects
  sit *in* its music or on top of it, and it is a property of the theme rather than of the app,
  so the house holds it to a band rather than to a value.

The trims the app applies on top of these (`with_gain`, `with_effects_at`) are read out of the
Rust and reported too, so what this prints is what a player hears rather than what is in the
file.

Usage:

    python3 engine/art/audio_levels.py            # the table, and what is out of band
    python3 engine/art/audio_levels.py --files    # every file, for chasing one sound

Needs `ffmpeg` on the path and `numpy`; it reads the repository and writes nothing.
