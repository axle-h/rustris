//! Fire-and-forget pieces thrown off something, in **board cells** rather than pixels.
//!
//! It is the particle source's idea (`particles/source.rs`: emit a group and then have no
//! further say) at the scale of one board, and it exists because the droplets a Mean Bean
//! Machine bean bursts into leave their own cell, cross several others and are still in the
//! air when the next chain step starts blinking. Nothing that is drawn *into* the board
//! texture can do that, and nothing that holds the tick can outlive the clear it came from.
//!
//! Positions are fractional cells and are **unbounded** - a piece may leave the board
//! entirely, which is why this is drawn on the window and clipped to the player rather than
//! into the board's own texture. One [`BurstSpec`] therefore fits any theme at any window
//! size, and the same spec serves a droplet, an arriving attack shattering over a tray, and
//! whatever a later theme wants to throw.
//!
//! Decoration, in the sense `popup.rs` establishes: it holds nothing, the board carries on
//! underneath it, and a theme that asks for no burst pays nothing at all.
