//! Steps a scripted Puyo Rusto match and writes one PNG every so many milliseconds, without
//! opening a visible window - so an animation can be *seen* rather than reasoned about.
//!
//! `frame_shot` renders one frame and replays only a clear's caption, which is enough to
//! check where things are drawn and nothing at all about how they move. This is its sibling
//! for the moving parts: the pop's blink and strip, the landing squash, the droplets thrown
//! off a burst, the ball crossing to the other board, the tray sliding in and the ragged
//! fall of a slab of nuisance.
//!
//! It reimplements the small part of `match_screen` that matters here - drain the events,
//! fan them out to the animations, and **skip the game's own update while an animation holds
//! the tick**, which is the rule the whole timing of a chain rests on.
//!
//! `scene` picks what it is a shot *of*: `chain` (the default) plays the match described
//! above, and `drain` buries player one on the spot so the game over drain can be watched -
//! the field falling off the bottom of the well, column by column, beside a board still in
//! play.
