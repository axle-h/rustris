"""Cuts puyo-rusto/src/theme/{menu,music}/*.ogg out of a set of converted rips.

    python3 puyo-rusto/art/music.py [source directory]   # needs ffmpeg with libvorbis

The source is a directory of OGGs and a `loops.json` naming each one's loop point, and it is
**not in the repository** - 12 MiB of source is not worth carrying, the way the sprite rip is
not. It defaults to `~/Downloads/pp/ogg`.

Two things have to happen to a track on the way in, and both are the engine's doing:

* `engine/src/audio/decode.rs` rejects anything that is not 44,100 Hz outright, and four of
  the five tracks are 48 kHz, so every one of them is resampled.
* the mixer has no loop marker: `StructuredMusic::new(intro, repeating)` plays one file once
  and then loops the other forever. So a track is *split* at its loop point into
  `<slug>-intro.ogg` and `<slug>-repeat.ogg`, which is the same pair Dr. Rustario's themes
  already ship.

The split is made on raw PCM rather than by seeking with ffmpeg's `-ss`, so the seam falls on
the sample the loop point names and a repeat joins where the intro left off.
