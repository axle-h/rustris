"""Cuts a retro theme's music and sound effects out of that game's own rips.

    python3 puyo-rusto/art/retro_audio.py genesis    # needs ffmpeg with libvorbis
    python3 puyo-rusto/art/retro_audio.py snes

One subcommand per theme, the shape `rip_retro.py` already has - `genesis` is Dr. Robotnik's
Mean Bean Machine and `snes` is Kirby's Avalanche. The sources sit under
`puyo-rusto/art/retro/<theme>-music` and `<theme>-sfx` and are **not in the repository**, on
the same footing as everything else in `art/`: they are downloads under their own names and
re-running this means finding them again. A dump that ships both a lossless render and
somebody's transcode of it is taken at the lossless one - see `source`.

What the engine will take, and so what comes out of here:

* OGG Vorbis at exactly 44,100 Hz - `engine/src/audio/decode.rs` rejects anything else - at
  `-q:a 6`, which is what `music.py` and `sfx.py` already write.
* the mixer has no loop marker, so a track is *split*: `StructuredMusic::new(intro, repeat)`
  plays one file once and loops the other forever.

## The music, and why the split is measured rather than read

The rip renders a track the way this kind of rip always does - the intro, then the loop
**twice**, then a fade over the last ten seconds or so - and carries the loop point only as a
table of whole seconds, which is a third of a bar out at this tempo and would put an audible
stumble in every loop. So the split is found in the audio instead: the lag at which the render
repeats itself is the loop length, to the sample (`loop_length`), and the first block from
which it repeats is where the loop starts (`loop_start`). The table's seconds are kept as the
hint the search starts from and as the assertion it has to agree with, so a rip that is laid
out differently fails here rather than shipping a broken loop.

Landing *late* on the loop start is harmless and landing early is not - the render is periodic
from the true start onwards, so any later point loops just as seamlessly, while an earlier one
drags a bar of the intro into the loop. `loop_start` therefore reports the run it is sure of
and never reaches back before it.

**Mean Bean Machine's four stage tunes each loop from their first bar**, so none of them is
cut into a pair - the theme is handed four tracks that simply repeat, and the mixer is told
there is no one-shot. Nothing picks between them, a match is dealt one.

The rip does carry a `Stages 1-4 Intro` beside each of them and it is tempting to read that as
the lead-in half of the pair. It is not: that is the music of the *stage announcement screen*,
which the game plays before a match rather than at the top of one, and using it puts nine
seconds of interstitial in front of every match. What the search finds at the head of a stage
tune itself is 0.25s - one `loop_start` block, which is the block size and not an intro.

## Kirby's Avalanche, which names no loop at all

The SNES dump is a set of SPCs rendered to wav, and an SPC carries a *play length* and a fade
in its ID666 tag but no loop point - not even the whole seconds Mean Bean Machine's rip writes
down. So there is nothing to seed `loop_length` with and `loop_period` sweeps every lag
instead. That works here because of how these particular renders are laid out: each is its
tune played through **exactly twice and cut off dead**, with the tag's fade never applied, so
one lag scores near 1 and nothing else comes close.

Its stage tunes then loop from their first bar rather than opening on a lead-in the way Mean
Bean Machine's do - the `Stage Intro` tracks in that dump are the pre-stage screen's own
looping music and lead into nothing. What `loop_start` finds at the head of each one is not a
musical intro but the quarter second or so in which the SNES's echo buffer fills: the render
is bit-identical between the two passes from that point on and audibly thinner before it. Cut
there, and the pair the mixer gets is the cold start the game itself opens on and a loop with
the echo already under it.

There are three of them where Mean Bean Machine has four, which is why nothing here says how
many tracks a theme must have.

## Levels, which are the whole game's and not one theme's

A console dump is quieter than the modern rip everything else here comes off - Kirby's
Avalanche by four decibels, Mean Bean Machine by three - and it is also *peakier*, having no
compression on it. So `music_gain` lifts each cut as far as `reference_music_level` or as far
as the headroom allows, whichever comes first, and for both of these it is the headroom: they
end up peaking at `MUSIC_CEILING` and still a couple of decibels under the particle theme.

One gain over the whole set, never a normalise per track: the levels within a dump are the
game's own mix and are meant to be uneven, which is `sfx.py`'s rule.

What is left of the gap is not a gain's to close, and it is not closed here. Take the mean peak
of a theme's effects over the RMS of its music and every theme of Rustris and Dr. Rustario
lands between +6 and +13 dB, with Rustris's Game Boy theme at +9; this game's retro themes were
at +15 before the lift above. The rest comes off the effects, in
`src/theme/data.rs`'s `EFFECTS_TRIM` - a number there rather than a gain in the files because
`sfx.py`'s rip is not on this machine, so the particle theme's own set cannot be re-cut and
every other theme is levelled against it where it stands.

## The sound effects, and the two places this differs from `sfx.py`

`sfx.py` says in as many words that it does not normalise, because the levels are the
original's mix and are meant to be uneven. This rip has no mix left to keep: **every one of its
sixty files peaks at the same sample value**, -0.5 dBFS, so a bean settling arrives as loud as
a stage fanfare. Levelling is therefore not editorialising here, it is undoing what the rip
did. Each effect is scaled to the peak of *the particle theme's own sound for the same slot*,
read off `src/theme/sfx/` at run time rather than written down here - that theme's rip came
with its levels intact, and matching it is what makes the two themes sit at one volume.

The silence the rip pads both ends with is trimmed off first, with a short fade over the tail,
exactly as `sfx.py` does it.

The second difference is that one effect is not cut from the rip at all: `hard-drop`, the only
slot in the theme standing in for an action Mean Bean Machine does not have, is *built* - out of
the game's own noise, because the rip has no whoosh anywhere in it to take. See [`whoosh`]. It
is levelled by the same rule as everything else and needs no exception to it.

## Kirby's Avalanche's effects, which are a capture and not a rip

There is no sound effect rip of this game. What there is instead is a recording of its own debug
sound test, split at the silences into forty six clips - `snes-sfx/manifest.tsv` is the split's
record of what it cut - so a slot names a clip by number and [`clip`] finds the file. **That
numbering is the split's and not the game's**: recording the sound test again and splitting it
again renumbers everything in [`SNES_SFX`], which is the one way this source is worse than a rip.

A capture also keeps what a rip throws away, which is where a sound sits in the field. This game
pans: garbage lands on the side it was sent to, the sound test plays it where the game would, and
that clip is therefore hard right with digital silence in the other channel. An effect the mixer
places itself has to be centred, so the loud channel is copied over the silent one - see
[`centre`]. Nothing else in the capture needs it; every other clip has its two channels within a
decibel of each other.

The trim is the Genesis rip's, unchanged. **The levelling is not**, and the difference is the
one thing about this source worth getting right: a recording of the running game still carries
the game's own mix, so its effects are moved as a *set* rather than one at a time. See
[`set_gain`].

Nothing here is built, either. This capture carries a fall - ninety milliseconds from 5.8 kHz to
1.3 kHz - so `hard-drop` is cut like everything else and [`whoosh`] stays the Genesis theme's
alone.

#
# **Every slot here was chosen by ear**, against the game, the way `GENESIS_SFX`'s were not and
# says so. What the audio decided on its own is only which clips were worth listening to, and
# for the pops it decided the whole answer:
#
# * **The pops are one sound pitched up.** Clips 07 to 13 are seven recordings of the same
#   length, 0.690s, at the same peak, whose spectra match one another under a shift of about a
#   tone a step - 07 to 08 is +2.1 semitones, 08 to 09 +2.1, 10 to 11 +1.1, and so on up. That
#   is the chain ladder, the shape Mean Bean Machine's `chain_1..7` has, and `clear_class`
#   grades a step 0..3 so it is the first four that are wanted.
# * **`hard-drop` is the only clip that falls.** Score every one of the forty six for how far
#   its brightness moves over its length and clip 15 is alone in the short ones: 5.8 kHz down
#   to 1.3 kHz in 92ms. It is a third the length of the hard drop the other two themes play and
#   is cut at its own length anyway, a sound being shorter than its neighbours' being no reason
#   to stretch it.
# * **`garbage` is the hard right one**, which is [`centre`]'s whole job. Clip 21 is the same
#   sound recorded hard left and is not wanted twice. Two other clips are panned this way and
#   neither is used: 30 and 31 are one pair, and 32, 33 and 41 are one sound right, left and
#   centred.
#
# There is no `settle`: the game plays one sound for a pair coming to rest and for the puyos
# left standing dropping into the gap a group left, so the theme cuts `lock` and points both
# slots at it rather than carrying the same file twice. Clip 42 is a second recording of that
# sound, 2.7 dB quieter and otherwise the same, and is not wanted either.

# The hard drop, which is the one sound in this theme that is **made** rather than cut.

# Mean Bean Machine has no hard drop, and unlike every other borrowed slot it has nothing close

# tone and for how far its brightness falls over its length: the best whoosh in the game is
# `sfx_12`, a bright hiss that collapses into a 200 Hz tone, which sat in this slot for a while
# and is not a whoosh. Everything noisier than it sweeps the wrong way - `sfx_20` is the
# noisiest thing the game owns and its brightness *climbs*, because it is an impact and not a
# fall. There is no whoosh in there to find; the game never needed one.
#
# So the material is borrowed and only the gesture is built. `sfx_20`'s body, past the impact
# that opens it, is a third of a second of the Genesis's noise channel and nothing else, and a
# whoosh is that noise under a cutoff sliding downward with an envelope that swells and drops.
