"""Cuts puyo-rusto/src/theme/{sfx,menu}/*.ogg out of a rip of Puyo Puyo Tetris 2's sound effects.

    python3 puyo-rusto/art/sfx.py [source directory]   # needs ffmpeg with libvorbis

The source is the sound effect rip as it is distributed - a directory of `<name>.acb (What
It Is)` folders of WAVs - and it is **not in the repository**: 33 MiB of source is not worth
carrying, the way neither the sprite sheet `rip.py` cuts nor the tracks `music.py` splits
are. It defaults to sitting next to this script.

This used to be `audio.py`, a chiptune synthesiser: the theme's art was procedural then too.
Both are the rip now, and a game's sound effects are the one place a synthesiser has nothing
to say - the sound of a chain climbing is the sound Puyo is *known* for, and an approximation
of it is just wrong.

Two things happen to a sound on the way in:

* `engine/src/audio/decode.rs` rejects anything that is not 44,100 Hz outright and the rip
  is a mixture of 44.1 and 48 kHz, so every one of them is resampled. Mono and stereo both
  decode, so whichever the rip made a sound is what it stays.
* the silence is trimmed off both ends, with a short fade over the last of it. The rip pads
  a sound out to a whole number of somebody's frames - a quarter of a second of nothing after
  a chain step that has to land again before the next one does - and the head it trims is
  latency on a key press.

What is *not* done to them is normalising. The levels are the original's mix and they are
meant to be uneven: a puyo settling is a fifth the height of a nuisance drop because it is
supposed to go unnoticed, and levelling them would put a landing thud on top of the win
fanfare.
