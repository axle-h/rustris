//! The agent that plays a board: it thinks about the pair in play across as many frames as it
//! needs, then presses the keys to put it where it decided, at whatever rate its difficulty
//! allows.
//!
//! **Thinking is spread over frames.** The search is the expensive thing this game does, and
//! doing it all in the frame the pair spawns in means one stall of a millisecond on a desktop
//! and a tenth of a second on a handheld. But the agent has no need to answer in a frame: a
//! pair takes a second or more to fall, which is sixty frames, so [`Search`] is stepped
//! once per frame and the answer is taken when it is ready. The search is not made smaller to
//! fit a slow device - it is taken in pieces, which costs nothing at all.
//!
//! Three things follow, and all are handled below. The pair goes on **falling** while the
//! search runs, so the keys the search worked out from where the pair *was* are no longer the
//! keys to press - they are worked out again from where it is. The pair may come to **rest**
//! before the search is done, on a board too full to fall through, so the search has to be
//! interruptible: it is, because every placement is scored before the first step and only
//! sharpened after it. And the **tray** can fill in the meantime, so what is waiting to land
//! is read when the answer is taken rather than when the thinking started.
