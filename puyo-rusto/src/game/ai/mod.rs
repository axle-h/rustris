//! Puyo Rusto's ai: the board it thinks on, what it thinks a board is worth, the placements it
//! can reach and the search that picks between them.
//!
//! The architecture is Dr. Rustario's - a `*AiKind` the agent dispatches on, a placement
//! search that replays real moves, and a difficulty ladder whose rows were *measured* against
//! each other rather than ordered by hand. What is behind it is not: Dr. Mario 64 was
//! decompiled and its scorer could be ported, and there is no equivalent here. Puyo Puyo's own
//! cpu opponents have never been decompiled into anything readable - Mean Bean Machine's is in
//! an unlabelled 68000 disassembly and Puyo VS's own (`Puyolib/AI.cpp`) takes the biggest chain
//! in front of it and otherwise places at random - so this one is built out of the open
//! literature instead:
//!
//! * [ama](https://github.com/citrus610/ama) (MIT), the strongest open Puyo Puyo Tsu ai, is
//!   where the evaluation terms, the quiescence search in [`quiet`] and the beam's shape come
//!   from. It is small enough to read end to end, which is why it was followed rather than
//!   [puyoai](https://github.com/puyoai/puyoai)'s hundred-feature `mayah`.
//! * takapt's beam search - searching past the queue down several invented continuations -
//!   by way of ama's six fixed ones. See [`beam`].
//! * Ikeda, Tomizawa, Viennot and Tanaka, *Playing PuyoPuyo: two search algorithms for
//!   constructing chain and tactical heuristics*, which is what both of the above cite.
//!
//! **There is no neural model here and there will not be one** (Alex, 2026-09-04). The search is
//! the ai; nothing in this module is shaped around a `Genome` and `ga puyo` trains nothing.
