//! The Genesis theme: Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine, cut out of the spriters-resource
//! rips by `puyo-rusto/art/rip_retro.py`.
//!
//! Mean Bean Machine is Compile's Puyo Puyo with Robotnik's cast painted over it, so its
//! board is this game's board exactly: six columns, twelve rows, a sixteen pixel bean, and
//! beans of a colour that touch drawn joined. That last part is why the rip could be used at
//! all - the sheet carries every one of the sixteen link variants, and the script reads which
//! is which off the arrangement rather than being told.
//!
//! Everything here is in the Genesis's own pixels: the panel is cut straight out of the
//! game's 320x224 board and the block is 16, so `reference_block_size` scales the lot up
//! together and the theme is drawn at whatever size the window allows.
