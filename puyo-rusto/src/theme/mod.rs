//! Puyo Rusto's themes: data handed to the engine's theme builders.
//!
//! Three of them: `genesis`, `snes` and `modern` (the particle theme), oldest first, which is
//! the theme sprint's order and the retro playlist's.
//!
//! **A fourth was built and cut**, `3ds` (Puyo Puyo Chronicle), on 2026-08-28 - `git log` has
//! it. Modern art in a retro slot, and, the part that cost something, **its panel sized the
//! board for every other theme**: cell size is set by the largest all of a game's themes can
//! hold, so one theme's panel dimensions are load-bearing for the rest. `SceneType::Cover` was
//! written for it and is kept. If the slot is ever filled again it wants something 16-bit
//! whose sheet carries the frames a bean needs to pop.
