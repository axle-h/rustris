//! The SNES theme: Kirby's Avalanche, which is Compile's Puyo Puyo with Kirby's cast painted
//! over it - so its board is this game's board exactly, six columns and twelve rows of a
//! sixteen pixel blob, joined when they touch.
//!
//! The blobs come out of the "Blobs & Boulders" rip. **Everything else comes out of the game**,
//! because that sheet is the only playfield art there is: no board, no background, no font. It
//! is not screenshotted either - `puyo-rusto/art/rip_retro.py` drives the emulator, pokes the
//! SNES's own main-screen register in a savestate and renders the background layers on their
//! own, without the blobs, without Kirby and without either player's HUD. The long version is
//! in the script, next to `SNES_LAYERS_BOTH`.
//!
//! What the game leaves in the panel is its own furniture: the flower border, the wooden centre
//! column, `NEXT`, and the `SC` label the score is drawn after. Its own score and its own stage
//! number are painted out, since this game prints neither in that place.
